# off42 for Windows

This separate Rust workspace implements six native Windows apps; the macOS Swift apps remain separate. The current
implementation is a work in progress, not a feature-parity or Windows release claim. Native interaction, printing,
scanner hardware and PDFium interoperability still need testing on a logged-in Windows desktop.

## Build and run

Install stable Rust with the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain, Visual Studio Build Tools with the Desktop C++
workload and Windows SDK, and Python 3. In a Developer PowerShell from the repository root:

```powershell
cd rust
cargo test --locked --workspace
Push-Location scripts
rc.exe /fo windows-app.res windows-app.rc
Pop-Location
$env:RUSTFLAGS = "-C link-arg=$((Resolve-Path scripts/windows-app.res).Path)"
cargo build --locked --release -p img42 -p doc42 -p xls42 -p ppt42 -p pdf42 -p scn42
python scripts/fetch-pdfium.py target/release
.\target\release\pdf42.exe
```

Run the other apps from `target/release` similarly. The resource embeds common controls v6 and PerMonitorV2
settings. PDF42 uses the adjacent `pdfium.dll` for text search and selection; the fetch script supplies a pinned
runtime and licenses. `PDFIUM_ARCHIVE` can select a local pinned archive. A custom `PDFIUM_DLL` also requires
`PDFIUM_DLL_SHA256` and `PDFIUM_LICENSE_DIR`. SCN42 OCR requires a separately installed Tesseract executable and
language data; select its path and available languages in the app.

For a GNU cross-build on macOS or Linux, install the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` Rust target, MinGW-w64 tools and
Python 3, then run `rust/scripts/package-windows.sh` from the repository root. It creates
`build/rust-port-windows/Suite42-windows-x64.zip` with PDFium and licenses. `rust/scripts/package-source.sh` creates
the source archive and excludes build outputs and local `AGENTS.md` and `STATUS.md`. Cross-building does not verify
Windows runtime behavior. The Windows CI workflow also builds with MSVC.

## Implemented scope and limits

| App | Current implementation | Important limits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DOC42 | Rich text, lists, images and tables with merge/split, sizing and formatting; comments, notes, links, range bookmarks and linked TOC; DOCX, RTF, ODT, HTML and Markdown subsets; ruler, preview and print | Office adapters are bounded; individual table-edge styles and revisions are incomplete. TOC requires explicit refresh, which invalidates cached page numbers; unsupported annotation or TOC exports refuse fidelity loss. The editing canvas is not fully paginated. Markdown image sidecar saves are not OS-atomic. |
| XLS42 | Native grid with sizing, frozen/hidden rows and columns, merged cells, selection, typed clipboard and inline editing; sheets, formulas, tables, styles, validation, charts, filters and paginated print; XLSX and ODS adapters | Pivot summaries are materialized, not interactive Excel pivots. Dynamic arrays, complex imported tables and structured references are incomplete; complex ODS changes and active filter/print export are guarded. |
| PPT42 | Mixed-run in-place text editing, native objects, multi-selection, grouping and rotation, slides, timed cut/fade/push-left slideshow transitions and printing; PPTX/ODP adapters | Complex source text and existing source-group structural edits are guarded. Complex source transforms and rotated source groups may be preserved without rendering. ODP transition duration is limited to 250/500/1000 ms. Object animation, full master/theme semantics, charts and media playback are incomplete. |
| PDF42 | WinRT rendering; PDFium search, selection and supported top-level text-object edits; annotations, forms, nested bookmarks, attachments, password-prompted PDF open and AES-128 copy, compression, printing, image export and raster redaction | Complex text, forms and navigation remain guarded. Protected files use conservative permissions; new AES-128 passwords require 1–32 printable ASCII characters, and original permissions and encryption are not preserved. Encrypted interoperability is unverified. Redaction removes metadata, attachments, forms and navigation. Trusted digital signatures and PDF/A conformance are not supported. |
| IMG42 | Transforms, tone, text, masks and lasso; directory navigation, GIF/WebP frames, multipage TIFF, PDF and bounded SVG import; standard EXIF fields, DPI/ICC, folder batch export and printing | Proprietary MakerNote, TIFF EXIF subdirectories, palette/CMYK and floating-point TIFF remain limited. TIFF and PNG support 16-bit edits; other 16-bit sources may require conversion. Some PNG metadata requires a converted copy; profile conversion is not color-managed. Batch PNG/JPEG exports the first frame; TIFF exports all frames, with explicit 8-bit white flattening. |
| SCN42 | Asynchronous WIA acquisition, PDF import and WIC processing; v4 projects with stable page IDs, DPI, OCR language and geometry; batch Tesseract or Windows OCR, Unicode searchable PDF, deskew, perspective correction, cleanup, compression, image/TIFF export and printing | Tesseract and its language data are external; Windows OCR requires installed languages. Windows OCR and physical devices have not been exercised. |

Shared save snapshots detect changes to existing destinations and use atomic replacement. Multi-file saves stage
sidecars before the main document with verified reuse and best-effort rollback; they are not OS-atomic. Async open
keeps the existing document and session until the new identity is verified and loading succeeds. The apps include
native commands and toolbars, document history, asynchronous work and cancellation. Format support is a subset, and
preservation varies by feature and source file; test important documents before relying on round trips.

## Labels, barcodes and signatures

- In PDF42, DOC42 and XLS42, **Production → Create Barcode** saves a PNG with physical resolution metadata.
  Choose QR, Data Matrix, Code 128 or Aztec. Code 128 accepts printable ASCII. Check the final size after
  inserting a PNG into another application.
- **Production → Create Label Sheet** exports a vector A4 PDF. Set label dimensions and gaps in millimetres,
  a copy count, and the first slot to skip used positions. PDF42 and DOC42 can start with selected text.
  XLS42 uses displayed values and skips hidden rows and columns. Column numbers count visible selected columns.
  Enter 0 to omit the barcode or copy-count column, and 1 in the header field to skip the first visible row.
  Print at actual size (100%). Label text uses the bundled Noto Sans glyphs; scripts that require text shaping
  and characters absent from that font need another text workflow.
- In XLS42, select part of one column and use **Production → Fill Serial Numbers** to enter literal identifiers
  such as `0007` or `PCB-0007`. Filtered or hidden rows are skipped. Undo restores the whole operation.
- In all six apps, **Signatures & Stamps** imports PNG or JPEG copies into the shared local library
  in `%LOCALAPPDATA%/off42/Signatures and Stamps`. Use **Insert from Library** to place an image.
  PNG imports retain transparency; import can remove white paper. IMG42 and SCN42 place the mark in a pixel rectangle
  and support Undo/Redo. SCN42 clears OCR for a changed page and restores it with Undo. These are visual marks.

## Spreadsheet pictures

XLS42 inserts PNG and JPEG pictures at the active cell. Click to select, drag to move, double-click for
position and physical size, or press Delete. Each edit supports Undo/Redo. Pictures follow row and column
insertions, respect hidden anchors and print at their recorded size, including page clipping.
Native XLS42, XLSX and ODS output contains the image and geometry. Supported PNG pictures in external
XLSX/ODS packages can be moved or deleted, and new pictures can be added while preserving unrelated ZIP
parts. Cropped/rotated drawings and unsupported image formats remain opaque. CSV export rejects pictures.
Technical PNG files retain the same editable recipe and physical width used by the macOS apps.

## Native text proofing

DOC42 and PPT42 enable inline spelling through Windows Rich Edit and TSF. The Edit menu toggles it.
Available languages and proofing tips depend on installed Windows text services.
[Microsoft documents the Rich Edit language options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/controls/em-getlangoptions).

## Validation boundary

Workspace tests and cross-build checks do not establish native event dispatch, controls, rendered output, DPI,
printing, scanner acquisition or third-party interoperability. On Windows, exercise actual controls and keyboard
commands, Undo/Redo, failure paths and save/reopen for representative documents in each app. Test PDFium alongside
the packaged executable, print to file, and separately test scanner hardware and installed OCR languages. Retain
fixtures for defects and record the executable identity and any skipped checks.

## Technical objects inside documents

In PDF42, DOC42, XLS42 and PPT42, **Production → Insert Symbol or Code** places a QR, Data Matrix,
Code 128, Aztec or technical symbol at the current document location. **Edit Symbol or Code** changes
the saved value, format, caption and width in millimetres. Choose an object if several are available;
PDF42 lists the current page. Insertion and replacement each form one Undo step.
PNG recipes survive DOCX/ODT/RTF, XLSX/ODS and PPTX/ODP exports for the supported image objects. PDF42
uses the same `/Suite42TechnicalElement` annotation key as the macOS implementation and restores the
editor after reopening. PDF42 stores resource-free vector paths, including outlined captions; Office
formats retain PNG pictures with recipes. **Create Symbol or Code** exports PNG, SVG or an editable
vector PDF without changing the current document.
